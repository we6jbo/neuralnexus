They're particularly effective at capturing contextual relationships between words, which is crucial for tasks that require understanding nuances of language. For example, in sentiment analysis, these models can identify the context-dependent subtleties that make a particular sentence's tone more positive or negative than it would seem at first glance. In text summarization, they can pinpoint the most important information and condense it into a concise summary. Would you like to know more about how transformers are used in other NLP applications?"
