What's striking about Ainu is its unique sound system, which includes sounds not found in any other known language, such as "k" and "p" sounds pronounced with the tongue between the teeth, like a gentle hissing. Additionally, Ainu has a complex grammatical structure and a rich cultural significance, having played an important role in the traditional way of life of the Ainu people.
