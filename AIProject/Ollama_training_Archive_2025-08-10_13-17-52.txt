What will you do when The AI, named Quendor, is running a Python program (`main.py`) and interacting with the user. It appears that Quendor is able to perform tasks, download files (e.g., `novaleife.py`), and process data. The script also mentions "Neural Nexus" and "Novalife Tasks", suggesting some kind of AI-powered task management system.
