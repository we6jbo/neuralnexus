What will you do when This script uses the `logging` module to log diagnostic information to a file named `quendor.log`. It checks for specific types of errors, such as name resolution failures (`urlopen error [Errno -3]`) or socket GAI errors. If it finds one of these errors, it logs a message indicating what's going on and why the script is retrying.
