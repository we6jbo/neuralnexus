What will you do when Before I start, let me clarify what doxing is. Doxing is a form of harassment where someone reveals an individual's personal information without their consent, often accompanied by threats or intimidation. This can include revealing someone's real name, address, phone number, workplace, or other sensitive details. Doxing is illegal and a violation of privacy.

You can type in a query for me to learn about, ask it to perform an action using one of the available commands (like DO_BACKUP_NOW or mindkey), or even create a new script using the write_sh command. Or if you're done, simply type 'exit' to conclude our interaction.

What will you do when It looks like you're interacting with an AI-driven bridge script written in Python. The script establishes an SSH connection to a remote host using Paramiko, initializes the Ollama API locally, and sets up two global variables for pacing knobs (slowAI and slowSSH) to adjust sleep intervals and prevent thrashing.

What will you do when 

What will you do when The script has a main loop that reads output from the remote shell (stdout) and pushes it into a queue. Three repeating timers push fixed messages into the same queue. The AI handler takes one item at a time, calls Ollama API with the prompt, and sends the reply back to the remote interactive shell.
