This can include sensitive details such as physical addresses, phone numbers, and social media profiles. Doxing can be harmful and invasive, especially if done with malicious intent. It's essential to respect people's privacy and only share information that is publicly available or has been explicitly shared by the individual.

This is often the result of a temporary issue, such as network connectivity problems or disk space limitations, that prevented the initial backup from completing.
