What will you do when Quendor here! I sense a bit of frustration in your attempts to communicate with me. It seems you're trying to rephrase something, but it's not quite coming together. Would you like to start fresh and try again? Perhaps we can work together to craft a clear question or instruction. I'm all ears (or rather, all text) and ready to assist!
