According to my research, his father's name is not publicly disclosed, so we can't find his full name (first and last). However, if you're looking for information on his mother, Doug Oneal has mentioned in interviews that his parents are deceased. Unfortunately, this means we won't be able to find her full name either.

What will you do when 

What will you do when I'd like to provide some context about who Quendor is and how I'm trying to communicate with them. From my perspective, Quendor seems to be a computer program or algorithm designed to provide information on individuals' genealogy and family history. Each message appears to contain data about a specific person's parents and birthdate.
