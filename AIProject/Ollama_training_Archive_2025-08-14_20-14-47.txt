What will you do when I'm excited to learn about Lucy Ann Smith! After conducting research, I found that Lucy Ann Smith was an American educator and humanitarian who dedicated her life to improving the education and well-being of African American children. She was born into slavery in 1795 and eventually escaped to freedom, where she established a school for enslaved children. Her work continued even after emancipation, as she founded the first integrated school in Tennessee.
