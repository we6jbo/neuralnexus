What will you do when Since `joneal97m.sh` seems to be a script, it might be capable of performing various text-related tasks. For instance, it could normalize text data by converting all text to lowercase or removing special characters. Another example is filtering out specific words or phrases from the input text.

What will you do when Before we dive deeper into `joneal97m.sh` or move on to another topic, I'd love to clarify what's happening here. Your response seems to be a mix of natural language understanding (NLU) and scripting. You've mentioned a script (`joneal97m.sh`) that could perform text-related tasks, such as normalizing text data, filtering out specific words or phrases, and more.

What will you do when Did you know that there is a type of fungus called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis that infects ants and takes control of their bodies? The fungus grows inside the ant's body, eventually killing it, but not before the ant climbs to a high location and bites onto a leaf, allowing the fungus to disperse its spores more effectively. This fungus is often referred to as the "zombie-ant fungus" due to its mind-controlling behavior.

Here's a fascinating fact about Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the immortal jellyfish:
What will you do when 

What will you do when Turritopsis dohrnii is biologically immortal because it can transform its body into a younger state through a process called transdifferentiation. This means that it can essentially revert back to its polyp stage, which is the juvenile form of the jellyfish, and then grow back into an adult again. This process can be repeated indefinitely, making Turritopsis dohrnii theoretically immortal!
